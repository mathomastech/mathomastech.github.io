For several years now, I have been a dual booting Linux user. Late last year, I made the decision to go all in. Although I did maintain a Windows machine for a few months for gaming, even that is now gone. With the move to all Linux, I decided to invest (or rather have my work invest) in a "Made for Linux" laptop. The System76 Galago UltraPro.

A bit of additional background before I detail my experiences with the UltraPro. I am a professional web developer at a local college. I am also a full time Arch Linux user, and do quite a bit of Linux desktop software development. I also enjoy gaming, and even use to do it competatively. I consider myself a hardcore user.

With all that out of the way, lets dig into the laptop!

<h2>Recommendation (TL;DR)</h2>
If you are just interested in the highlights and not a lengthy breakdown, then this section is for you. But If you want all the juicy details, continue reading!

- For a Linux user, this is a really great option. 

- Biggest complaint is battery life, but at a solid 3-4 1/2 hours, it's probably sufficient for most people. 

- The performance and build quality are excellent.

- Linux compatability is a excellent.

- Little annoyances, such as miscalibrated magenetic tension are merely annoyances, not show stoppers.

- The overall build quality is only slightly less than that of a Macbook.

- I highly recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a really good Linux laptop.

<h2>Choosing System76</h2>

I had been hearing about System76 for a few years now and nearly bought one myself last year when my old (2007) laptop finally bit the dust. At that time, the UltraPro was not yet on the market, and the Gazelle Professional was what I was looking at. Regretably, I chose a Macbook Air primarily for its amazing battery life. Unfortunately, that battery life came with a trade off, hardware support. The biggest offender being WiFi, but that is far from the only issue I ran into. So, when time came at work to get a new laptop, I chose to break the mold and not go with the standard Macbook Pro. Instead, I requested a System76 Galago UltraPro.

My request was never rejected, but it did raise a few questions. Considering that no one in the IT department had ever used a System76 machine, there was concern over hardware quality, questionable battery life, keyboard issues, and various other unknowns. Each of these concerns and more I will address here to hopefully help others make an informed decision.

<h2>Specs</h2>

<h2>Overall Build Quality</h2>

First off, lets talk about build quality, and run some comparisons with the industry leader in build quality, the Macbook Air/Pro. As far as overall build quality goes, this laptop feels very premium. It is made out of plastic, not aluminium and has a very subtle "brushed" look, something that isn't obvious when viewing pictures online. The ports all feel very solid, with no worrys of cables slipping, or getting knocked out easily. Also, the ports themselves feel very secure in the casing. The hinge for the screen feels ever so slightly flimsy when opening the lid by holding onto the corner of the laptop, instead of the center. It's not flimsy to the point of me being worried, but it's enough that I notice it. One of the biggest annoyances with the hardware so far is actually the magnetic release calibration of the lid. You should be able to use one finger to open a lid from its closed position to open without having the base of the computer come up off the desk. However, that is not the case here. Using a single finger causes the base to rise with the lid for about an inch before it releases. It's somewhat annoying when the laptop is laying flat on a table, but since I often have it sitting in a laptop stand, I've actually caused the laptop to rise over the lip of the stand and slide down. It's a somewhat minor detail, but for what apears to be a laptop thats given a lot of consideration to detail, it really messed up on this one.

<h2>Screen</h2>
The screen is one of the first things I noticed when I booted up. Having come from using non-retina Macbook Pros and Airs (1440x900), the UltraPro resolution (1920x1080) was stunning, beautiful, and painful. I had never seen text so small and clear on a screen before. That being said, it took a few hours before I was able to adjust to the small text. There are still times though, where the text is so small on a web page that I have to zoom in a bit. 

The screen is also a matte display, instead of glossy. I personally have never cared for glossy screens before, which is what most laptops come with, so I am very happy with the matte option. The color recreation also seems spot on. The color recreations are at least as good as the latest Macbook air running OSX. The last thing to mention about the screen is the bezel around it. The bezel seems somewhat large, especially on the bottom. It's not something I notice when focusing on the screen, but when admiring the laptop, it stands out, and not necessarily in a good way. If you are use to the edge-to-edge screen of a Macbook Pro, this bezel might seem obtrusive. That being said, it doesn't negatively effect the screen itself, just the overall look of the laptop.

<h2>Keyboard</h2>
Next up is the keyboard. There are a handful of things about the keyboard to be aware of. The first thing I noticed was the "clickyness" of the keys. Not in a loud way, but more of a physical feedback way. Its got a lot more physical feedback that a Macbook keyboard. This is one of those things that comes down to personal preference. Macbook keyboards use to be my favorite keyboard, so much so that I even have invested in the Apple desktop keyboard for when I use my laptop with external keyboard/mouse/monitor. I have recently however found that I enjoy mechanical keyboards more, and am even looking at purchasing a DAS keyboard in the near future, but thats another review for another time. The UltraPro keyboard has a more "mechanical" feel to it that the Apple keyboard, but of course is nothing like a true mechanical keyboard. Unfortunately, the only way to know if it feels good to you is to try it out.

A lot of people complained about the keyboards on their UltraPro not working. As it turns out, those issues only pertained to the really early version of this model. That particular defect has long since been corrected and any UltraPro's shipping today come will the revised version of the keyboard. If by some off chance you happen to get a bad keyboard, System76 has taken ownership of the issue and given directions on how to replace the keyboard with one they will send you for free.

Key placement is something else that I noticed right off the bat with this keyboard. Again, coming from a Macbook keyboard, I am accustomed to a specific layout. This is NOT the same layout. Some noticable differences include: Fn and Ctrl are swapped. Dedicated Del, Home, PgUp, PgDn, and the End key. The arrow keys are dangerously close to the end key, and the right shift is both smaller, and not directly beneath the enter key. These are not the only differences but I mention these specifically because each one of them have caused me typing errors at least once, some several times. That being said, typing is heavily based on muscle memory, and after spending a few weeks with this laptop, none of these differences cause me issues anymore, except occasionally hitting end when aiming for the up arrow. I suppose my pinky is just a bit to long. I've actually noticed now when going back to using my Macbook Air that I have been making some typing errors I would not normally make. As stated earlier, it's a muscle memory problem more than anything else. Once you get use to one layout, switching to a different one takes a bit of time.

<h2>Trackpad</h2>
One major concern I had was the quality of the trackpad. I have never found a trackpad I liked outside of the Macbook trackpads. I have used several by Dell, HP, Thinkpad, etc and always despised them. I even carry around a USB wireless mouse to plug in if I ever need to deal with someone elses laptop. I expected a sub-par trackpad here and had already resigned myself to just turning off the trackpad and using my wireless mouse exclusively once I decided on this laptop. Well, I am happy to report that this is not the case. This trackpad is good, or to be more accurate, really good. Its got a very similiar feel to the Macbook's. It supports single, double, and tripple finger tapping and clicking (left, right and middle). The actual click feels solid, though having used Macbook Trackpads for years I am more accustomed to tapping. My fingers glide across the trackpad with no resistance and the mouse's response on the screen is perfectly accurate. In fact, the only thing I don't like about it, is that the bottom right corner of the trackpad acts as a right click, and this has caused countless right clicks, when I simply wanted a left click. I also wouln't mind the trackpad being a little larger, as there seems to be nearly 1/2 inch combined below and above it that it could expand into, but it's not really necessary. Overall, I am extraordinarily impressed with this trackpad and have no reservations using it. In fact, the only time I break out my wireless mouse is for some light gaming or when working with photo editing, both activities that I would use a dedicated mouse regardless if I was using a System76, Macbook, or anything else. There is just no way to beat the precision of a mouse in situations like those.

<h2>Battery Life</h2>
My single biggest concern about the System76 laptops in general, is that official battery life is not listed anywhere on their website. However, reading various reviews, the concensus for the Galago UltraPro seems to be somewhere around 3-4 hours. The good news is that my experience actually exceeds that, coming in at a solid 4 1/2 hours. Now the disclamer. This is 4 1/2 hours of running vim, Firefox, and Geary. A relatively light load. No videos, music, or any applications that are known for being excessively power hungry. I suspect that if I where doing any of these other activities, I would be seeing a healthy 3 hours. It can't be ignored, this level of battery life is quite frankly abysmal for 2014. With the latest Macbook Airs clocking in at 12-14 hours, Macbook Pros seeing 7-9 hours, and even Arch Linux on that same Macbook Air clocking in around 9-11 hours, we should be seeing better battery life that 3-4 hours. Whether the problem lies in the efficiency of Linux, or hardware optimizations, I honestly dont know, but for the end user, it doesnt really matter. 3-4 hours is 3-4 hours whether it is a software limitation or a hardware one. I doubt I will have much problem making 4 1/2 hours work for me on a daily basis, so this limitation is more acedemic than realistic, however as someone who works in tech and attends conferences somewhat regularly, there will be several times a year I will wish for all day battery life so I dont have to carry around a power cable.

<h2>Hardware Compatability</h2>
This was one of the most important factors for me when I was researching laptops. After having dealt with the compatability issues on my Macbook Air, WiFi being the main offender, I was done dealing with it. As a full time Linux user, It didn't seem right to buy hardware that added additional barriers to using it. After having used the Galago UltraPro for a few weeks now, I cringe anytime I boot up and update my Macbook Air. It's a gamble as to what might break, and I've lost all desire to maintain it. That being said, the Macbook Air will very soon be formatted and reinstalled with Mac OSX, although I doubt I will use it very often. So essentially what I am getting at is that all the hardware works wonderfully! The function keys, and keyboard backlights all worked perfectly after installing the "system76-drivers" package from the AUR. The WiFi has given me no problems. This installation of Arch was the smoothest install I have ever run, more on that in the next section. The graphics card using the open source drivers is very stable, and is even capable of some rather intense gaming, more on that below as well. All in all, I have yet to find a piece of hardware on this laptop that has not worked exactly as I would expect it to. System76 machines come with the Latest Ubuntu pre-installed, but because they submit their changes back to the Kernal, and provide the drivers for other distributions to package up, I was able to get Arch running with no significant hassles, and presumably any other distro would fare just as well.

<h2>Installing Arch</h2>
As mentioned above, installing Arch Linux on this machine was the smoothest install of Arch I have ever done. And I have done quite a few on various pieces of hardware including a Macbook Air, Macbook Pro, and a custom desktop. On other hardware, I have had some incompatability with Grub showing warnings and errors of unsupported, unrecommended hardware, but nothing like that happened this time. When setting up my WiFi, I made a few mistakes which have nothing to do with the hardware, but rather a few missing Arch packages that I didn't know I needed. For instance, to get all the networking (WiFi, ethernet) to work properly, I had to install "networkmanager" and turn off dhcpd and turn on "networkmanager" by running the following commands "systemctl disable dhcpd && systemctl enable networkmanager". In the end, it turned out to be a lack of knowledge problem, rather than a hardware one. I also ran into an interesting issue where the trackpad did not work right away. Thinking that the "system76-drivers" package would solve that, I was dissapointed when it still didn't work. Turns out that an additional package "xf86-input-synaptics" was required. My main complaint about the install process in Arch is that the "system76-drivers" package did not list the 2 previously mentioned packages as dependencies. This might be more of a AUR problem than a System76 problem, but either way it should be resolved.

<h2>Gaming</h2>
As a former competative gamer, I generally have very high expectations on a games performance when playing. While I prefer my games graphics settings to be maxed out, I am willing to make an exception for the UltraPro soley because it is a laptop, and not one designed specifically for gaming. With that in mind, I found myself to be very impressed by its performance. The few games I have tried so far have worked near-flawlessly. In Counter Strike: Global Offensive, after turning the graphics down to mediium, I had very smooth gameplay with no noticable frame drop. Both video and audio seemed perfectly synced, an no out of the ordinary lag. I also have played about 20+ hours of War Thunder, and am also very pleased with the performance. Although I have noticed the occasianal dropped frames, mostly when a match initially starts. It seems to correct itself pretty quickly. I am not sure if this is a limitation of the open source drivers, or some bugs in the game, after all War Thunder was only released for Linux about a month ago. For casual to semi-competative gaming, this laptop is very suitable. If you want the best performance you can possibly get, then I would recommend looking at the Bonobo Extreme, or one of their tricked out desktops, both of which provide you with dedicated Nvidia graphics options. The UltraPro's Intel graphics card is good, but it's no Nvidia.

<h2>Alternative Operating Systems</h2>
Based on the hardware inside of all System76 rigs, there is nothing that would lead me to believe there would be hardware incompatabilities with Windows. Additionally, I have read several reports that Windows runs just fine, although I have not tested it myself, and have no intention of doing so. So if you plan on running Windows on this machine, you should be fine, but a bit of extra research would not hurt.
