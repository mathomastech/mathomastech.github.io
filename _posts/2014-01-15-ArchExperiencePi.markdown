Not long ago were the days where Linux was considered to difficult to use for the common person. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, those days where mostly history before I first began dabbling with my first Linux system, Ubuntu 9.04. Although I didnt become a full time Linux user until sometime in the following years, I was able to successfully install and begin using it without the need to spend weeks of research and study. We are now in an age where anyone who has the desire to try Linux can, sometimes with a bit of help, learn how to install and run a distribution. In fact, dozens of Linux distributions are going out of their way to make themselves known as a system for new users. Just to name a few would be Ubuntu, Mint, and Raspbian.

With these new systems being so user friendly, much of the existing user base have been split into two camps. Those with the old philosophy of being computer elitists, and those that want everyone to experience what free and liberated open source software can do for them. My following categorizations of these two groups are based on my experiences and are a generalization. Obviously, there are individuals in these camps that do not take on all the qualities, but as with any generalization, I will be focusing on some of the most common qualities. 

What about these elitists. What makes them so different from the other group in the Linux community. Well, not just anybody can join but rather an individual must prove themselves, and until thats been done they are shunned. The asking of questions, especially those that label an individual as a noob, are met with sarcastic, demeaning responses. The answerer making it clear just how superior he is to you, and making it apparent that he is doing you a great favor by donating his oh so valuable time to such a noob. The public view of them is that they are the hackers, a ridiculously misused term by mainstream media - though that is another post all in itself.

The other camp is quite a bit different. The camp that, if I may be so bold as to say, Canonical pioneered with its Ubuntu operating system is one of open acceptance. They go out of their way to cater to new users. Not just new to Ubuntu, but new to the much broader Linux. This means lots of fancy GUIs, well written and up-to-date support documentation. Developing a community around it to help new users through support forums, IRC, local community organizations. Canonical has gone far out of its way to give new users the best possible chance to have a positive experience installing and running their operating system. When a new user asks a question, they arent shunned, they are guided. Canonical, and many of Linux communities have been working to make Linux a welcoming community to join.

This second camp I spoke of is the camp I found when I first discovered Linux. I came from having been using Mac OSX for several years, and before that Windows XP, 2000, and ME. I considered myself quite tech savvy and saw Linux as a challenge, one that I wanted to tackle. I dove into Ubuntu and after several false starts finally succeeded. Years later I found myself using it full time and enjoying every minute of it. I have the Ubuntu community specifically, and the larger Linux community to thank for all their help in learning the ins and outs of using Ubuntu. I am now one of those people that answer others questions in IRC, on forums, and in various G+ communities. I even have taken over as the organizer of the Northfield Linux User Group because I am so excited about where Linux has been and more importantly where it is going. All this led up to wanted to expand beyond Ubuntu and try another similar, but radically different system. Arch Linux.

Arch Linux has a reputation of being for the hardcore elitists. Nothing is pre-configured for you, everything must be installed and configured by the end user. Its a daunting proposition for someone who has not had to do that with a Linux system before, let alone for someone who has never used Linux of any sort before. However I have been following Arch for a while and have been very intrigued. I recently ordered myself a Raspberry Pi and concluded this was the perfect time to try Arch! What follows is my experiences getting it up and running, and my view of the community supporting arch.

The Raspberry Pi comes with a software called Noobs (New Out Of Box Software) which allows you to install the official Raspbian OS and several other Pi optimized systems on an SD card, which is what the Pi boots off. One of these was Arch. The actual install was a seamless experience. Literally a single click followed by a prompt or two and then the rest was done for me. Exactly as someone would expect. After the install, I booted up into Arch as was met with a command line. Nothing else. Having experience using the command line it didnt take me long to get my bearings. A few Google searches and I learned how to add a user, update the system to the latest software, install a few applications such as vim, set my local timezone, and other basic things. None of which required a command line from a system like Ubuntu, but this isnt Ubuntu. Expectations for Arch are different, and so none of this bothered me. In fact I quite enjoyed learning how to do these arbitrarily basic things without the aid of buttons and maps and pretty pictures.

There was however a limitation. In an attempt to install a desktop environment, I came to a grinding halt. Scouring the Arch wikis, I found tons of information on how to do it, but none that actually worked. I later came to the conclusion that the wikis, while immense and well documented, leaves out key things. Thanks that Arch users assume you know. Things that a new user, even one experiences with other Linux systems would have no idea about, and worst, not know what questions to ask to get the right answers.

This wasnt a completely new situation for me, however. I have gone through forums in the past that provide partial or misleading answers. But they always give me enough information that when talking to a live person say on IRC, I get my answer, and usually quite quickly. So I did the same here. I went to the official #Arch channel and asked my question. Explained my setup and what I have done so far and its results (or rather lack of). It was only a few moments of waiting before I had a response. The response was quick and informative, and not the first time I got a response similar to this. "This is the wrong channel, go to #channel-name.". Its often difficult to find the exact channel to ask in. Luckily, going to the main channel and asking will often prompt someone to redirect you to a more appropriate channel. This response was not surprising at all, in fact it was somewhat expected. 

It was his next response took me completely off guard." Of course, if you couldnt even find your way into the right channel, I doubt youll get far with using Arch" When I read that, I was so completely taken off guard that I just sat there rereading my original question trying to find what prompted such a response. No luck of course. So I switched channels and continue my search for answers. I asked the same question in the new channel, and got a response from three different people. One was the same individual from the other channel, and he proceeded to be very unhelpful, asking why I was trying to install a desktop environment, when it would merely bog down the system. The second individual joined in the conversation and provided no help, except to affirm the first individual. Finally, after explaining why I wanted a DE (not something that really needs to be explained IMO), all they said was that I shouldnt do it. Completely and utterly unhelpful. Had I been a new user, I would have packed my bags right then and there and left. Why should I, a new user to Linux, put up with such helpfulness when trying to learn something new, when I could much easier just do what I am use to doing already, and use my old familiar system. Luckily a third individual spoke up and asked said only eight words."Have you started the x server with startx". I did a quick Google search on what startx was and what it did, then tried it and viola, my desktop environment was up and running.

That last individual took a look at my question, and realizing I was a new user prompted me to try something that is muscle memory for veteran Arch users. Something that I would never have known to do, and something that is not readily apparent in the Arch wikis. Its such as basic thing, that experienced people forget they even do it, and fail to mention it to new people. The first two individuals who "helped" me had no interest in helping. Only in showing how superior they were because they were Arch users. They had gone through the same things I have already gone through, and because of that they feel superior. Unfortunately, that does nothing encourage new people to try out Arch. In fact, it actively pushes people away. This was a common practice before the days of Canonical bringing new users to Linux is troves, and providing them with the support they needed.

Individuals such as the first two contribute greatly to the public opinion that Linux users are elitist haters. That Linux is to complicated and out of their reach. That may have been not to many years ago, but things have changes. Unfortunately, some people, like those two individuals, do not appear to want change and because of individuals like them, many potential users may get turned off before they have a chance to see how wonderful and fulfilling using Linux can be.

For now, I intend to continue using Arch. As I stated, the Arch wikis are very well written and comprehensive, albeit lacking in some key areas. My use of Arch was and is primarily an educational one, and so far it has been very education, both in using the new technologies and in uncovering a new, or rather old, Linux camp.
