<strong>Google Tasks:</strong>

I have been using Google Tasks for many years now as a simple to-do list. During my college years, I created a list for each class, and then put all the relavent assignment and due dates in their respective lists. Currently, I have 3 active task lists.

<ul>
	<li>Personal: For things like bill payment dates, chores, etc.</li>
	<li>Tech: For technologies I want to learn, or apps to check out.</li>
	<li>Training: For scheduling workouts.</li>
</ul>

I have found myself using calendar events to replace a lot of what I use to use tasks for however, because while Google Tasks is not a new product, it hasn't changed much since its inception and is missing a lot of features.

<ul>
	<li>Recurring Tasks:</li> 
		There is still no way to set a recurring task, such as monthly rent.
	<li>Calendar Integration:</li> 
		This is one of the features I do like about Tasks. Having the tasks show up on the calendar, regardless if you created it in gmail or from mobile, is extremely valuable. That being said, it doesn't really work as I would expect it to. Only 1 list can be displayed on the calendar at a time. Considering I have 3 lists right now, and often times more, being required to cycle through the lists to view my due dates on the calendar is time consuming and often gets forgotten.
	<li>Task Entry (From Gmail):</li>
		The UI is not very clean, and doesn't comform to the rest of gmail. While most of Google's products are now sporting a fair bit of white space, and even the new card layout, Tasks in Gmail don't follow either of the conventions.
	<li>Calendar Widget:</li>
 		When you select the calendar icon in tasks, you see the same mini calendar widget that you would have seen several years ago. If you click through to the calendar widget in Google Keep under reminders, its a completely different widget.
 	<li>Mobile App, or Lack Thereof:</li>
 		There is a distinct lack of an official Google Tasks mobile app. I have used several over the years including: <a href ='http://astrid.com/'> Astrid</a>, <a href='http://todotxt.com/'> Todoo.txt</a>, <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.teamtasks.tasks.paid&amp;hl=en'>Tasks</a>, and several others I can't remember the name of. I have settled on Tasks for its simplicity, and the fact that it provides a fair amount of the features that Google Tasks lacks. 
 	<li>Task Entry:</li>
 		There are 3 main ways I create tasks. First, from a mobile app. As that is not a Google provided tool, I won't get into how that works. Second is from Gmail. Basic task entry is a breeze. Simply type G+K to open tasks and start adding. Of course, if you want to add a due date or any notes, that's where it get trickly. For the keyboard shortcut junkies among us, depression sets in as there are no shortcuts to work with. Date entry requires a minimum of 2 additional clicks. From the calendar, everything must be done by clicking. First clicking in the "All Day" section, then selecting task, then adding the task name. Adding tasks from the calendar sidebar is also click driven, with no keyboard shortcuts to help.
 	<li>Task Entry Trick:</li>
 		Not to counteract my previous point, but there is one saving grace for task entry in gmail. If you set your tasts to sort by due date, you can then, using the keyboard shortcuts, add a task under an already created date, saving several clicks for date assignment. That being said, you must have your tasks sorted by due date, and the desired due date already created. Due dates appear only if there is already a task listed under that date. This solution has to many dependencies to be used regularly, but there are enough cases I've run into where this method of entry can be used. Especially if you are creating a long list of items to be assigned to the same day.
</ul>


So why is Google Tasks being so heavily ignored by Google? Why is there not even an official Android app? Would it be best to move onto something that is feature rich and regularly updated? Why bother even sticking with Google Tasks?

I do not have all the answers to those questions, but here are my thoughts on the last 2. I choose not to move away from Google Tasks, despite the lack of development attention and lack of features because of how heavily I use gmail and google calendar. I always have gmail open, and seeing my to-do list in my inbox is a subtle, yet constant reminder of what needs to get done. It's integration with calendar, albeit limited, is also something I would have a hard time working without. While there are many other to-do apps available, my favorite alternative having been one called <a href="http://nitrotasks.com/#" target="_blank"> Nitro </a>, none of them have the benefit of being always visible in my gmail and calendar apps.
