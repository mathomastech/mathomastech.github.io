Hello World!

My name is Marc Thomas. I am a database developer, and recent college graduate. I started building this website back in February as a personal project to teach myself HTML. This website is the accumulation of a couple hours a week, every couple weeks. The entire website at the time of this post is written completely in HTML and CSS. It is using the Jekyll framework and being hosted by Github pages.
