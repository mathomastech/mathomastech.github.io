Hello World!

My name is Marc Thomas. I am a database developer, and recent college graduate. I started building this website back in February as a personal project to teach myself HTML. This website is the accumulation of a couple hours a week, every couple weeks. It is using the Jekyll framework and being hosted by Github pages. Some of my future plans for this website are to expand my knowledge into javascript and angular js.
