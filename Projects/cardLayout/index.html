        <p class="content"> Here is a <a href="https://github.com/mathomastech/cardLayout" target="_blank">link</a> to the card layout library on Github. It will have the most recent version of the library, which may not necessarily be what you see in front of you right now if you are viewing this on http://mathomaste.ch

        <h3 class="header hCenter">Card Anatomy</h3>
        <p class="content"> The card design has 4 main parts. 
        <ul>
            <li><strong>card:</strong> basic, left, right, small, medium, large</li>
            <li><strong>header:</strong> left, right, center</li>
            <li><strong>content</strong></li>
            <li><strong>footer:</strong> left, right, center</li> 
        </ul>        
        Each card should use only what it needs, and nothing extra. The following cards will show you the different options you can use to build your cards. Header and footer placements can be mixed and match. For instance, you can combine a left header and a right footer, or a center header and a left footer. Use whatever combinations you feel are best for your content. Be aware that using multiple headers or multiple footers on a single card does not work.

<section class="card">
    <h3 class="header hLeft"> Left Header</h3>
	<p class="content"> This is an example of the basic card. This card resizes itself vertically to match the amount of content contained within. The width of the card will span the length of the screen. You can use this by implementing the "card" class. This card is also using the left oriented header which is implemented by using the "header hLeft" class.</p>
    <p class="footer fLeft">Left Footer</p>
</section>

<section class="card">
    <h3 class="header hCenter"> Center Header</h3>    
    <p class="content"> This is an example of a centered header and footer.</p>
    <p class="footer fCenter">Center Footer</p>
</section>

<section class="card">
    <h3 class="header hRight"> Right Header</h3>
    <p class="content"> This is an example of a right header and footer.</p>
    <p class="footer fRight">Right Footer</p>
</section>


<section class="card left">
  <!--  <h3 class="header hRight"> Right Header</h3> -->
    <p class="content"> This is an example of a card that emcompasses only half a screen, and who's height changes based on the quantity of content inside the card. This card is longer than the one on the right. Because of the different heights between this card and the one to the right, you may need to put break statements below this set in order to reset the alignment of cards below.</p>
</section>


<section class="card right">
  <!--  <h3 class="header hRight"> Right Header</h3> -->
    <p class="content"> This card is much shorter than it's left neighbor. To make them the same size despite quantity of content, choose a fixed size card instead.</p>

<section class="card left small">
	<h3 class="header hHalfLeft"> Small left card </h3>
	<p class="content"> This is an example of a card that encompasses a small left portion of the screen. The card is best used if you have only a small amount of information to display and you would like to display additional content beside this. Use this by implementing the "cardLeftSmall" class.</p>
</section>

<section class="card right small">
	<h3 class="header hHalfCenter"> Small right card</h3>
	<p class="content"> This card is identical to the small left card, except that it occupy's the right side of the page. Use in the same fashion as the small left card, and implement using the "cardRightSmall" class.</p>
</section>

        <p class="content"> This is an example of a card that encompasses a medium left portion of the screen. The card is best used if you have only a medium amount of information to display and you would like to display additional content beside this. Use this by implementing the "cardLeftMedium" class.</p>
