<p>Earlier this week, I ordered myself this <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BNQCSE6/ref=ox_ya_os_product' target='_blank'>CD slot mount</a> for my car in order to mount my Nexus 7 and use it for navigation. I have a 2013 Toyota Prius with a built in display and navigation. It&#8217;s a phenominal car with only 2 complaints. The speakers are sub par, and the built in maps are running Bing.</p>

<p>For the run of the mill person who doesn&#8217;t care what maps are being run, only that they have navigation, that isn&#8217;t really a problem. But I had been using my Nexus 7 and Nexus 4 for navigation in my previous car that when switching to the build in maps running Bing, it felt like going backwards. For the most part, the Bing maps are good. They &#8220;usually&#8221; have the POI&#8217;s I need in their database, and the directions get me where I need to go. But that&#8217;s about it.</p>

<p>The first problem is that it is ugly. Absolutely downright ugly. I am obsessive about good visual design and Bing maps are just unbearable.</p>

<p>Second, the voice controls are good, but no where near as accurate or as fast as Google&#8217;s voice recognition.</p>

<p>Third, the on screen navigation is horrid. It took myself and another individual (both very tech savy people and both developers) a ridiculous amount of time just to figure out how to cancel a navigation. It&#8217;s buried in a menu that isn&#8217;t even labeled logically.</p>

<p>Fourth, it doesn&#8217;t auto zoom in and out depending on what kind of road you are on. Here is an example to make this point clearer. When I am on a highway I want to be able to see ahead for the next mile or so to see turns, exit numbers, etc. In order to do this, I have to tap the - button several times to get the correct zoom. Now, when I exit a highway and go into a town, I want to see no more than maybe a 1/4 mile ahead of me, because I need to see accurately which roads to turn on. But the map doesn&#8217;t auto adjust, so I can&#8217;t see any sort of detail, and thus have missed my turn several times. I have to hit the + button several times to see details. Horrible design and even a bit dangerous!</p>

<p>Fifth, It doesn&#8217;t have the Google database. This is obvious considering this is Microsoft&#8217;s version of maps, but nevertheless it is relevant. Google&#8217;s POI database is far larger and more accurate than anything else on the market. Additionally, I have run into a few scenarios were even manually putting in an address in Bing would return no result. Where as putting it in Google Maps took me to the doorstep of my desired location. Bing claimed the road and address didn&#8217;t exist. However, when I arrived (thanks to Google Maps), the road was in fact on the screen of Bing Maps. Seems there is a disconnect there?</p>

<p>Sixth, lack of multi touch. This is more a failing of the screen rather than Bing itself, but it&#8217;s still an issue. If I want to rotate the map, or do any sort of visual manipulation to see whats coming up at a glance, it&#8217;s nearly impossible with the built in dash.</p>

<p>There are probably lots more failing that have bugged me about Bing maps, but these are the major ones that I just can&#8217;t tolerate anymore. So I am setting up a rig for my Nexus 7 in my car to increase my sanity.</p>
