<div class="post">

<p>Back in 2009/2010, I began work creating a detailed, and comprehensive solution to manage my finances. This began at a time before I was studying computer science, and thus had no significant knowledge in how to write an application. So I went with what seemed an obvious choice, and that was to use a spreadsheet. Being an Apple user and having purchased the iWork suite of software, I began building my budget using “Numbers”. It was a phenomenal application to work with. Like everything Apple puts out on the market, it was easy to use, and aesthetically appealing. After several weeks, I had a minimally functional but working template to begin using. For the remainder of 2009 and 2010 I used that very 1.0 product. Prior to 2011, I learned of Google Docs, now <a href="https://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a>, and how it’s web hosted solution would allow me to access the spreadsheet from any computer. That wasn’t immediately important as I only used one computer, my laptop, but I decided to convert my spreadsheet over to Google Doc’s in anticipation of web technologies being more prominent. What a decision that was!</p>

<p>It was around that time in 2010 that I first dual booted my machine with Ubuntu Linux (10.10 I believe). After porting over the document to Google Doc’s, I found just how convenient it was to have access from anywhere, regardless of being booted into Mac or Linux. Prior to 2012, I decided to make some changes and improvements to the template. I fixed a handful of calculations, and added a few categories of purchases. Nothing major, just things I knew where missing. It was during the 2012 version of the budget that I shared the document with my girlfriend so that she could benefit from expense tracking. What’s more, is that my template benefited from the feedback that she provided. Things like “I wish the budget had this category”, or “Why does it do this, shouldn’t it do that instead?”. Little observations which I recorded and then implemented for the 2013 template.</p>

<p>In the last several months, I have been working on tons of bug fixes, calculation enhancements, and two significantly involved sheets to help budget not just for today, but for the coming months, and even for the coming years. These two sheets are “Projections”, and “Loan Projections”.</p>

<p><strong>Projections</strong> <br /> This sheet was designed specifically to analyze a user’s monthly recurring expenses such as: Rent, Utilities, Loans, Gym Memberships, etc, etc. It is also designed for the purpose of helping the user plan their future expenses, and to see what kind of impact a significant purchase next month, or even next year will have on their financial stability. I built and tested this sheet in the template, but found it so ridiculously useful that I decided to back port it back to both my 2013 budget, and my girlfriends. It is currently in production and has had a huge impact on my spending habits.</p>

<p><strong>Loan Projections</strong> <br /> This sheet is designed to help with a problem many people face, debt. While I don’t own any credit card myself, I do however have student loans. I designed this sheet to help me see where my debt will be at any given month over the next 10 years. The formula’s used in this sheet take into account interest, or APR, as well as a set monthly payment. The calculations are even smart enough to allow you to alter a specific months payment, higher or lower, without effecting the set monthly payment for other months.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> <br /> These two new sheets are beautifully dynamic, extremely powerful, and wonderfully useful. In fact, I have found this document remarkably useful even before the 2014 improvements. So much so that I have decided to make it publically available to anyone who wants it.</p>

<p>To view the working copy of the template, take a look <a href="https://drive.google.com/templates?view=public&authorId=01784685571608047934">here</a>. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, as I am always trying to make improvements.</p>
