        <h3 class="header center">Card Anatomy</h3>
        <p class="content"> Each card design has 4 main parts.</p> 
        <ul>
            <li><strong>card:</strong>  full, left, right, small, medium, large</li>
            <li><strong>header:</strong> left, center, right</li>
            <li><strong>content:</strong> left, center, right </li>
            <li><strong>*footer:</strong> left, center, right</li> 
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Cards</strong> can be made to span the entire width of the screen. They can also encompass only the left side, or only the right side. A card, by default, will size itself vertically based on it's containing content. However, there are a few options for fixed sizes which make matching a left and right card easier. Be aware that fixed size cards do not support footers at this time. If you intend to use a footer, use either a full size card, or a half size card without a fixed size.</p>         
        <p><strong>Headers</strong> come in 3 positions. Left, centered, and right. You can only use 1 header per card. Headers are supported on all variations of the <strong>card</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Content</strong> is where you will put the bulk of a card. By default, it will be left justified, but you can specify centered or right justification by adding the appropriate class.</p>
        <p><strong>Footers</strong> are used in the same way as headers. Left, center, and right positions are supported on all cards <strong>except</strong> fixed size cards. If you intend to use a footer, you must choose a dynamically sizing card type.</p> 
        <p>Each card should use only what it needs, and nothing extra. The following cards will show you the different options you can use to build your cards. Header and footer placements can be mixed and match. For instance, you can combine a left header and a right footer, or a center header and a left footer. Use whatever combinations you feel are best for your content. Be aware that using multiple headers or multiple footers on a single card does not work.</p>

<section class="card">
    <h3 class="header left"> Left Header</h3>
	<p class="content"> This is an example of the basic card. This card resizes itself vertically to match the amount of content contained within. The width of the card will span the length of the screen. You can use this by implementing the "card" class. This card is also using the left oriented header which is implemented by using the "header left" class.</p>
    <p class="footer left">Left Footer</p>
</section>

<section class="card">
    <h3 class="header center"> Center Header</h3>    
    <p class="content center"> This is an example of a centered header, content and footer.</p>
    <p class="footer center">Center Footer</p>
</section>

<section class="card">
    <h3 class="header right"> Right Header</h3>
    <p class="content right"> This is an example of a right header, content and footer.</p>
    <p class="footer right">Right Footer</p>
</section>


<section class="card left">
    <p class="content"> This is an example of a card that emcompasses only half a screen, and who's height changes based on the quantity of content inside the card. This card is longer than the one on the right. Because of the different heights between this card and the one to the right, you may need to put break statements below this set in order to reset the alignment of cards below.</p>
</section>


<section class="card right">
    <p class="content"> This card is much shorter than it's left neighbor. To make them the same size despite quantity of content, choose a fixed size card instead. Being dynamic allows me to use a footer.</p>
    <p class="footer center half">Center Footer</p>

<section class="card left small">
	<h3 class="header left half"> Small left card </h3>
	<p class="content"> This is an example of a card that encompasses a small left portion of the screen. The card is best used if you have only a small amount of information to display and you would like to display additional content beside this. Notice that none of the fixed cards have footers.</p>
</section>

<section class="card right small">
	<h3 class="header right half"> Small right card</h3>
	<p class="content"> This card is identical to the small left card, except that it occupy's the right side of the page. Use in the same fashion as the small left card.</p>
</section>

<section class="card left medium">
        <h3 class="header center half"> Medium left card </h3>
        <p class="content"> This is an example of a card that encompasses a medium left portion of the screen.</p>
</section>


<section class="card right medium">
        <h3 class="header center half"> Medium right card</h3>
        <p class="content"> This card is identical to the medium left card, except that it occupy's the right side of the page. Use in the same fashion as the medium left card.</p>
</section>

<section class="card left large">
        <h3 class="header left half"> Large left card </h3>
        <p class="content"> This is an example of a card that encompasses a large left portion of the screen.</p>
</section>

<section class="card right large lightGreen">
        <h3 class="header right half"> Large right card</h3>
        <p class="content"> This card is identical to the large left card, except that it occupy's the right side of the page. Use in the same fashion as the large left card.</p> 
        </p>Also note the color. Color can be added to any card easily. There are a handful of default colors that can be used. Feel free to add your own and modify the existing.</p>

<section class="card">
	<h3 class="header full">This is a full width header</h3>
        <p class="content title"> Blog Title </p> 
	<p class="content blog">This is an example of how a blog post might be layed out. Instead of using the traditional header, it may simply use a centered title. The body of the post also has increased margins. Here is a <a href="https://github.com/mathomastech/cardLayout" target="_blank">link</a> to the card layout library on Github. It will have the most recent version of the library, which may not necessarily be what you see in front of you right now if you are viewing this on http://mathomaste.ch
