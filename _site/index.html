Check out my <a href="/Resume" title="Resume">resume</a> for a more detailed view of my professional life.

    <h3 class="header left"> NORLUG - CHC </h3>
    <p class="content"> I am a Linux enthusiast and advocator. I am the organizer of the Northfield Linux User Group (NORLUG) and the Northfield chapter of Coffee House Coders (CHC). After moving to the Northfield Minnesota area, I found that the local Linux User Group has more or less died out. So I decided to revive it, and started by hosting weekly CHC events as part of NORLUG. There is a lot planned for NORUG in the 2014 year. Check out their new website which I built (and which the redesign of this website was based off) for the most current happenings with NORLUG.

	<h3 class="header left"> Gaming </h3>
	<p class="content"> When not working or otherwise developing, I can usually be found online gaming with my clan, <a href="http://hellboundsoldiers.org" title="HBS">Hell Bound Soldiers</a>. I am currently the Operations Officer (3rd level of command) within HBS where I oversee all the official game regiments, their commanders, members, and the game servers. My game genre's of choice are FPS (First Person Shooters) such as Call of Duty, and simulation games such as Arma and Minecraft. You can find me on Steam by clicking the link off to the right.</p>

	<h3 class="header left"> Healthy Lifestyle </h3>
	<p class="content"> I am a vegetarian, for health, not political reasons. I have been a vegetarian since just before Chirstmas of 2010. I spend a fair amount of time improving my lifestyle with activities such as marathon and triathlon training as well as developing and improving my healthy eating habits.</p>

	<h3 class="header left"> Music </h3>
	<p class="content"> Before I was pursuing technology as my profession, I had pursued music. I have a passion for music that I found was most enjoyable when it was a hobby, not a profession. My main instruments are flute and piccolo. I also have some experience with piano, guitar, and many other woodwind instruments. I don't currently perform, but I do have the desire to start up again sometime in the near future.</p>
