The HBS communicator is an application I am writing to help aid in the communication of clan members who can not always be online at the same time.

</ul>

This application is written in python. It connects to a remote ssh server, and a remote MySQL database. As for 3/17/2014, it can be run on both Linux and Windows manually. Creating a Windows executable is under development and should be ready soon.
