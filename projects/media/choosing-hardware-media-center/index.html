    <h1> Choosing Your Hardware - Media Center</h1>
    <p>Buidling a media center is similiar to building server in several ways, but there are enough differences to warrent it's own guide here. Much like with a server, you could simply repurpose an existing desktop. However, if you have the money to build a dedicated media center computer, I highly recomend doing so. As we discuss the various components, you will begin to see why.

    <p>Some things to keep in mind while you build your media center is that you will likely want to keep is as physicially small as possible. It should also be very fast, but quite. You might also want to consider the possibility of adding a dedicated graphics card in case you want to use it for gaming as well. This computer will most likely be living in your living room somewhere near your TV. The last thing we want is it being obnoxious in either size or noise. It would also be a bonus if it added to the asthetics of the room, rather than detracting from it.</p>

    <p><strong>Motherboard</strong></p>
    <p>Motherboards come in several different sizes. For a media center, I would recommend looking at Mini ITX boards. They are quite common, and significantly smaller than the traditional ATX boards. Since we will be running Linux, its best to find an Intel compatible motherboard. Intel has shown itself in recent history to have the best hardware support for Linux.
    <p>If you intend to use your media center computer for gaming, you should make sure your mother board has a PCI slot available for a dedicated graphics card.</p>

    <p><strong>CPU</strong></p>
    <p>There are a handful of really popular Intel CPU's on the market right now. Since we went with an Intel motherboard I would recommend something along the lines on an Intel i3 processor. If you intend to play some of the more graphically intense games, you may want to consider jumping up to an i5 processor.</p>

    <p><strong>RAM</strong></p>
    <p>I would recommend about 4 GB of RAM. It wouln't hurt to go with 8 GB if you intend to do a lot of gaming.  Keep in mind, you can always upgrade to more RAM later down the road if you find yourself maxing it out, and RAM is relatively inexpensive.</p>

    <p><strong>Graphics Card</strong></p>
    <p>Here, you essentially have 2 options. If you just intend to watch video's, the integrated intel graphics will be more than sufficiant to run your graphical needs. However, if you intend to do a lot of gaming, I would recommend getting a dedicated graphics card. Exactly which one depends on your budget and your needs, but I would highly recommend going with an Nvidia card. Their Linux support is the best on the market for dedicated graphics cards.</p> 

    <p><strong>Solid State Drives (SSD)</strong></p>
    <p>Despite solid state drives being more expensive, I highly recommend spending the extra money. Here's a few reasons why. First, they are fast...REALLY fast. On a computer that's sole purpose is to provide you with a entertainment experience, the last thing we want is it to be slow. Also, SSD's dont have any moving parts, so you won't get the spinning drive noise you would otherwise from a HDD. If you intend to play games, the performance benefits of SSD will be welcome, though keep in mind that SSD's are expensive, so if you intend to play a lot of games, you may want to have a second HDD to store the game data on.</p> 

    <p><strong>Power Supply</strong></p>
    <p>I would recommend visiting <a href="http://extreme.outervision.com/psucalculatorlite.jsp" target="_blank">this</a> website and plugging in your hardware specs. It will give you a pretty reliable estimate of how big of a power supply you will need.</p>

    <p><strong>Case/Chasis</strong></p>
    <p>For the case, there are 3 main things you want to look for. First, make sure it is compatible with the size of motherboard you chose. Second, make sure it has good air flow. This is important because your media center will most likely be running 24/7. Lastly, make sure it is capable of supporting a full graphics card if you intend to do gaming. The one I use, and highly recommend is the <a href="http://ncases.com/" target="_blank">NCASE M1</a>. This case is unique in that it was built by the hacker community. So the end result is a very high quality chassis that supports multiple drives, a full size graphics card, a DVD/Bluray drive, and everything else you could need in a very small footprint. It's also very minimal and asthetically pleasing in both silver and black. So it should not detract from your entertainment center at all.</p>
