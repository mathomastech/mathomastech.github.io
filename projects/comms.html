<strong>Note: Do to administrative issues within the clan this application was being built for, development of this application has been temporarily suspended. Development of this application may resume at a later date at the descretion of the developer. At which point, the app may be repurposed, or be developed for purely educational pursuit.</strong>

<p></p>
Comms is an application I am writing to help aid in the communication of clan members who can not always be online at the same time. It is intended to expand beyond a pure communicator and be able to streamline administrative tasks unique to the operating clan.
<p></p>


This application is written in python. It connects to a remote server via tcp and ssh, and a remote MySQL database. As for 5/22/2014, it has had its 5th beta release with version 0.10.0 and runs natively on both Linux and Windows. The communicator is built using the Qt framework for its multi-platform capabilitites.
