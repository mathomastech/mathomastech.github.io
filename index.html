    <h3 class="header center"> Linux - NORLUG</h3>
    <p class="content center"> I am a Linux enthusiast and advocator. I am the organizer of the Northfield Linux User Group (NORLUG) and the Northfield chapter of Coffee House Coders (CHC). After moving to the Northfield Minnesota area, I found that the local Linux User Group had more or less died out. So I decided to revive it, and started by hosting weekly coffee house coders events as part of NORLUG. Check out their <a href="http://www.norlug.org">website</a> for the most current happenings with NORLUG.</p>

    <h3 class="header center"> Healthy Lifestyle </h3>
    <p class="content center"> I am a vegetarian, for health, not political reasons. I have been a vegetarian since December of 2010. I spend a fair amount of time improving my lifestyle with activities such as marathon and triathlon training as well as developing and improving my healthy eating habits.</p>

    <h3 class="header center"> Music </h3>
    <p class="content center"> Before I was pursuing technology as my profession, I had pursued music. I have a passion for music that I found was most enjoyable when it was a hobby, not a profession. My main instruments are flute and piccolo. I also have some experience with piano, guitar, and many other woodwind instruments. I don't currently perform, but I do have the desire to start up again sometime in the near future.</p>
