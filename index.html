    	<p class="mainBodyContent">I am a software developer with personal open source projects in Web, and Linux. Check out my <a href="/Resume" title="Resume">resume</a> for a more detailed view of my professional life. Also check out my <a href="/Projects" title="Projects">projects</a> page for anything I am currently working on, or things that I am planning on working on in the future. On the right you will see links to different social mediums I use regularly, including Google+, Twitter, Github and LinkedIn. You can also email me directly if you would like a more one on one communication.</p>
    	<p>When not working or otherwise developing, I can be found online gaming with my clan, <a href="http://hellboundsoldiers.org" title="HBS">Hell Bound Soldiers</a>. I am an avid PC gamer. My specialty is FPS (First Person Shooters), specifically Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 for the time being. You can find me on Steam by searching for "Sniper_Zero", or clicking the link off to the right. I also spend a fair amount of time improving my lifestyle with activities such as marathon and triathlon training as well as developing and improving my healthy eating habbits.</p>
